When it comes to product reviews only two things matter:
1) Convenience - is it easy find?
2) Context - whose opinion is this? can I trust it?

The problem with Yelp and the like is that they confuse context for quantity, and convenience for features and length. If every review was easy to find, straight to the point, and came from a reliable source, there would be no need for 100+ reviews. Not only is one enough but it's actually better!

So, if you've ever asked a friend for a recommendation; from what movie to see, to the best thing on the menu - that is what Hundo is for. We are turning product reviews into social objects, making them searchable on the web and instantly accessible from your phone.

Solution

We have built a platform that automatically aggregates the noisy market data that signals apartment market movements. We make sense of this data by applying pricing algorithms that predict rental prices based on an apartment's location and attributes.
